src: chatgpt

To create a new release for your Python package on GitHub, follow these steps:

Push your updated package code to GitHub: Make sure that you have committed and
pushed all changes to your package code to GitHub.

Create a new tag: Navigate to the repository page on GitHub, and click on the
"Releases" tab. Click on the "Draft a new release" button. Enter a version
number for the release, and choose a name and description for the release. Click
on the "Publish release" button. This will create a new tag for the release.

Upload your package files: Once the tag is created, click on the "Edit" button
next to the release. Scroll down to the "Assets" section, and click on the
"Upload asset" button. Choose the package files you want to upload, and click on
the "Open" button. Repeat this step for each package file you want to upload.

Publish your release: Once you have uploaded all the package files, click on the
"Publish release" button. This will make the release available to users who want
to download and install your package.

Optional: Add release notes: You can add release notes for your new release by
clicking on the "Edit" button next to the release, and adding a description of
the changes in the release. This can be helpful for users who want to know what
has changed in the latest version of your package.

That's it! Your new release is now available on GitHub, and users can download
and install your updated package.
