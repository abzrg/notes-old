# How to contribute

This is my take on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIaOOYlbPWI)

1. Create an issue before you start and decide on a design for the problem/feature
2. Look for similar commits by looking into history (git log -G 'similar feature') and learn from them
3. Check anything similar and related in the project can be improved
4. Follow the conventions of the project
