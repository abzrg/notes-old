# Collaborate and Update

To download changes from another repository, such as the remote upstream, youâ€™ll use fetch:

```sh
git fetch upstream
```

Merge the fetched commits. Note that some repositories may use master instead of main:

```sh
git merge upstream/main
```

Push or transmit your local branch commits to the remote repository branch:

```sh
git push origin main
```

Fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch:


```sh
git pull
```
