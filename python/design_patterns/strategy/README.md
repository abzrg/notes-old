# Strategy Design Pattern


The __strategy pattern__ (also known as the __policy pattern__) is a behavioral
software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at
runtime. The strategy pattern:

- defines a family of algorithms,
- encapsulates each algorithm, and
- makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

This pattern promotes the _Open/Closed principle_ using _Composition_ over _Inheritance_
