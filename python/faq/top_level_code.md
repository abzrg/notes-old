# What does 'top-level' code refers to?

In Python, _top-level_ code refers to any code that is __not__ contained within
a function or a class definition. This includes _variable assignments_, _function
definitions_, _import statements_, and any other executable code that is at the top
level of a module file.

When you import a module in Python, the interpreter executes all the top-level
code in the module. This means that any functions or variables defined at the
top level of the module file are available for use in other parts of your
program.

For example, consider the following module file `my_module.py`:

```python
print("Executing top-level code...")

x = 1 + 2

def my_function():
    print("Executing my_function...")

print("Finished executing top-level code.")
```

When you import this module in another Python file, the top-level code is
executed, and the output is printed to the console:

```
>>> import my_module
Executing top-level code...
Finished executing top-level code.
```

You can then use the `x` variable and the `my_function` function defined in the
module:

```
>>> print(my_module.x)
3

>>> my_module.my_function()
Executing my_function...
```
