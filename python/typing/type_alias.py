a type alias declares two types to be equivalent to one another. Doing Alias
= Original will make the static type checker treat Alias as being exactly
equivalent to Original in all cases. This is useful when you want to simplify
complex type signatures. -- https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/typing.html
