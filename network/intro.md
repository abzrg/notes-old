# Introduction + History

## History of Internet and the purpose

- ARPANET:
  - The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network was the first wide-area
    packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first
    networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became
    the technical foundation of the Internet. -- Wikipedia
  - established: 1969
  - closed: 1990

- Internet:
  - birth: 1983 (with the birth of TCP/IP standard)
  - The Internet (or internet) is a global system of interconnected computer
    networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate
    between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of
    private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to
    global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical
    networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information
    resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and
    applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and
    file sharing. -- Wikipedia


## 7 Layers of the OSI Model


- application:
  - End user layer
  - HTTP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS

- Presentation:
  - Syntax layer
  - SSL, SSH, IMAP, FTP, MPEG, JPEG

- Session:
  - Synch and send to port
  - API's, Sockets, WinSock

- Transport:
  - End-to-end connections
  - TCP, UDP

- Network
  - Packets
  - IP, ICMP, IPSec, IGMP

- Data Link
  - Frames
  - Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge

- Physical
  - Physical structure
  - Coax, Fiber, Wireless, Hubs, Repeaters



### Some other notes

- different layers of abstraction so that you focus your attention only on one
  layer

- ethernet ports
  - IEEE 802.3

- wifi
  - IEEE 802.11

- modem (`MOdulator-DEModulator`)
  - use a non-digital network as an network (phone lines => internet lines)?

- router (switch routers)
  - layer 2: how to correctly route data to another computer

- hub vs switch
  - every computer on the networks know about the data sent to one computer

- LAN (local-area network) vs WAN (wide-area network)
